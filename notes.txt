1. Run proto file -
    protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. common.proto

Initial thoughts -
1. How does the client know that the request failed? Should we implement synchronous calls?
Or we can just have a timer in the client that if we don't get f+1 requests till then, we can mark the
txn as failed, and move on to the next txn.
